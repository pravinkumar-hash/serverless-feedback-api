📌 Overview
This project is a serverless feedback API built on AWS using Lambda (Python) and API Gateway (HTTP API).
The API accepts a JSON payload containing name, email, role, and message, performs basic validation, logs the feedback to CloudWatch Logs, and returns a structured JSON response. It is designed to run fully on AWS using a serverless architecture.

🏗 Architecture
Client (Thunder Client / Postman / Frontend)
→ Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API)
→ AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)
→ Amazon CloudWatch Logs

🛠 Tech Stack


AWS Lambda – Python 3.12 runtime


Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API) – public HTTPS endpoint


AWS IAM – execution role with basic Lambda permissions


Amazon CloudWatch Logs – centralized logging & debugging


Thunder Client / Postman – for API testing



🔌 Endpoint

> 🔔 Note: This API supports **POST** requests only.  
> Opening the URL in a browser will show **"Not Found"** because browsers send **GET** requests by default.  
> Use Thunder Client / Postman to test the API with JSON input.

📤 Sample Request

{
  "name": "Pravin Kumar S",
  "email": "pravinkumar25062004@gmail.com",
  "role": "Cloud & Python Enthusiast",
  "message": "Testing my AWS Serverless Feedback API built with API Gateway and Lambda (Python). The architecture is event-driven, scalable, and runs fully within the AWS Free Tier. Excited to apply these cloud skills in real-world projects."

📥 Sample Response

{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Feedback received. Thank you!"
}


🧠 Lambda Function (Core Logic)

The Lambda function:


Parses the JSON request body


Validates required fields (name, email, message)


Logs the feedback into CloudWatch Logs


Returns a clean JSON response


(Full code is available in lambda_function.py.)
